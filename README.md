## Introduction & Philosophy
*Paper* is an extremely legible, light colour palette “based on the colour of paper as found in various notebooks,” and originally created by [Yorick Peterse](https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse). As a result, *Paper* is [healthier for our eyes](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53264/dark-or-white-color-theme-is-better-for-the-eyes), making it the optimal choice for long-term viewing and a necessity in digital life.

Keeping to the [minimalist spirit of the original](https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse/vim-paper) `vim` plugin, only the most essential information is differentiated with colour. By using fewer colours reminiscent of a multi-pen, only the important is clearly identified, further enhancing *Paper’s* legibility in many applications.

Please note that the palette has been designed with the following display properties in mind:

- An LCD/TFT display
- A display temperature range of 4000K-5200K
- A low display brightness
